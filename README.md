Getting Started 
Step 1: Install Flutter SDK
Head over to flutter.dev and follow the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

The Flutter install guide is easy and explains everything, including how to set up environment variables.

When you’re done, open a terminal (or command prompt) and run:

flutter doctor

This command checks if your system is ready for Flutter development and tells you what else you might need (like Android Studio or Xcode).

Step 2: Get an IDE (Optional but recommended)
While you can use any text editor, I recommend using either:

Visual Studio Code with the Flutter and Dart extensions installed, or
Android Studio with Flutter plugin.

These tools make it easier to run the app. 

Step 3: Clone this project
If you don’t have the project files yet, clone them from the repo:

gh repo clone Amruthavalli-M/12DIT---BookTech


Then, locate to it by: 
cd booktech_flutter


Step 4: Fetch dependencies
Run this in your project folder to download the packages the app needs:

flutter pub get


Step 5: Run the app
For my best version, when you run the command below: select 1, the vindows version. 


flutter run

This will build and launch the app on your connected device.

Notes
This app currently stores booking data locally on your device.
The UI adapts to screen size, so you can test on phones, tablets, or desktop.
